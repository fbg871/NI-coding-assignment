## 1. Documentation

Documentation allows the codebase to be more maintainable in the long-run. It ensures that new developers joining the team can get up to speed quickly, but is also a useful resource for existing team members as well (because who remembers code they wrote a year ago).

## 2. Testing

Testing is important for ensuring good code quality, and makes development more efficient by reducing the amount of time developers spend debugging. Unit tests can verify that functions behave as expected. End-to-end testing would also be useful as it inspects the system in a real-world context. If implemented, this would likely have caught the state/comment bug from Task 2.

## 3. CI/CD

As the name suggests, the practice of CI/CD pipelines allow for continuous feedback during development - like automating tests after every commit. It also means development is more predictable.
